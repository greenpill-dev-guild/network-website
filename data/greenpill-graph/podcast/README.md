Files in this folder:

- [greenpill-podcast-feed.json](/Users/afo/Code/greenpill/network-website/data/greenpill-graph/podcast/greenpill-podcast-feed.json)
  - normalized feed catalog with episode metadata and base themes
- [greenpill-podcast-theme-summary.json](/Users/afo/Code/greenpill/network-website/data/greenpill-graph/podcast/greenpill-podcast-theme-summary.json)

- [greenpill-podcast-entity-index.json](/Users/afo/Code/greenpill/network-website/data/greenpill-graph/podcast/greenpill-podcast-entity-index.json)
  - flattened guest/entity index for quick filtering, legend building, and analysis
- [greenpill-podcast-network-overlap.graph.json](/Users/afo/Code/greenpill/network-website/data/greenpill-graph/podcast/greenpill-podcast-network-overlap.graph.json)
  - focused overlap graph showing how the podcast maps to Greenpill chapters, guilds, active people, and the shared operating stack

Generator:

- [build_greenpill_podcast_graph.py](/Users/afo/Code/greenpill/network-website/scripts/build_greenpill_podcast_graph.py)
- [build_greenpill_podcast_network_overlap.py](/Users/afo/Code/greenpill/network-website/scripts/build_greenpill_podcast_network_overlap.py)

Notes:

- the overlay graph is designed to be merged with the main network graph through shared node ids such as `greenpill-network` and `greenpill-podcast`
- guest extraction is heuristic
- external entity extraction is curated on purpose to keep the graph readable
- the overlap graph is smaller and more interpretive: it separates direct internal overlap from indirect overlap through tools, themes, and public operating infrastructure
